	<h1> MY QUIRKS</h1>

	<p> As Everyone else in this world I got a hand full of quirks. Due to my emotions my hair and skin changes color. It happens so suddenly depending on how intense it is. SAdly i am able to manifest terrible things with my imgination and it impacts me everyday. Which is why I try so hard to be positive and not let so many crap get to me.But as you have seen or read that doesn't happen. I keep this journal with me day in and out and I write my feelings and thoughts..and my greeds in here. I noticed when I got to sleep, all the things I wrote in my journal erase. I wrote in a piece of paper about it and..this journal resets my mind my afterlife. The ink disappears and blends with this journal. I am living an endless limbo and it just never ends. I never really realize how much time passes on due to this journal...I erased the note I had and I am letting it be. Being here hurts and I rather forget this than have it buried...See you later traveler..Next time I won't have this memory. Ciao...</p>
