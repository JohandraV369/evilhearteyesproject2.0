	<h1> Ether Plaza's Musical Touch </h1>

	<p>The place sounds super muffled and you can hear the bar fights 10 feet away. Lots
	of booming conflict, the usual thing here. Sadly I live in a runned down apartment, it was 
abandoned when I got here. Filled with minor leaks and it gets super cold in here at night. I would have to 
snag at load 3 to 5 blankets from the local stores. Don't worry I never get caught I got stealth! HA Ninja mode! It
at times can get super humid and hot in here. Depends on the day to be honest, there is always a time of day where 
the heat is at it's max and I just go and burrow into a corner looking for a small amount of cold. Just waiting for a shiver up
my spin to tel me I am okie I wont over heat or hide. When I try to sleep at night I here buses, coughing, yelling, screaming, everyhting. Everything here is just unpleasant. I hate it here the noises especially are torturous. i feel like ripping my ears out and dying. I can't rest neither do the people who live here..the noises are exguasting...i hate. it here. Your lucky to not be here traveler it stinks, it smells, the noises stink adn they haave smells. ARRRRGH the AGONY.</p>

	<h2> MY TRAITS</h2>
	<p> Sup traveler! Im glad you made it out on time. On whatever quest you had to deal with in your reallly amazing life! I bet it is so amazing compared to this dump. As you can tell I am a very chaotic person, one minute I am thinking about something the next I just want to pulverise the existence of others or myself.Lol, just feel things very intensely..and I am more of a heart kind of girl not logic! Pfft who needs math when you live in a society that is filled with addicts, or...no economy at all. We are disposible as I said earlier.Sadly enough I have the tendency to make rash decisions and they may or maybe not harmful. It just pinches others in their butt..and maybe somewhere else hehe. I don't intend to but after all that's happened to me before in my life..before this one..it's rough to talk about. I usually am in my head alot and due to this places unfriendlyness I am on HIGH ALERT. I stay up all night everyday and..I may or may not have paranoia. I can'e really enjoy much at times and it's more of a fake it till you make it case.I am more optimistic towards others yet for myself I am a basic basket case lol. I am the friend anyone cna have but the one I don't deserve..I am terribly and harliously not it.Due to my self sabetoging I..end up attracting bad juju..especially from others around me. I hate it,it's like a plague of annoying bugs attacking me every now and again. AND DONT EVEN ASK IF THAT'S HAPPENED BECAUSE IT HAS. I couldn't even eat for weeks, all they did was attack me.Hmph that low life king probably used them to attack me. He has zero life what so ever, in that disgusting throne of his. Aside from the horrors within myself and my life. There are many pleasures such as food, fun, did I mention fun and food a great combo. Gladly here we have great food. Which is the only reason why I am still alive here, if not I would have um did something lol. I don't know what but something.I love knitting and making hand crafts, need a bracelet I'm your gal, need a scarf I got you covered for the winter. If the king wasn't so trash, I would have made a nice business advocating for cats who need fur coats, I'd make them little sweaters and mittens. I also love adventuring and climbing! I am a productivity freak and I basically mastered the most basic skills any human can do. I need more iron in meh blood! I'll see you later traveler I'm going to dig a hole and see where it takes me. This place is hopeless and I need a way out! PEACE. </p>
