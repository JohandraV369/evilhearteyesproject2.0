<h1> WHERE I LIVE</h1>

<p> Yikes traveler..You made it so far already..It's not like I was waiting or doubting
You would come back or anything...Hahaha...yeaaah. Your much more attached to me than I thought, is it because I
am cool, sexy,fabulous...entertaining.Pfft just pulling your leg you guys must be curious of me! You must wonder
WHERE DOES THIS CRAZY CREATURE LIVE! I live in DA GHETTO. Well it's considered the ghetto in this universe...well my astral realm is.
You see the place I live in is called Ether...Ether Plaza. It's where do not freak out, Where all the demons and ghouls go for redeemtion.That is what the higher one's like to say, but in actuality this is a dump. A huge dump where all the lost souls or the homeless go. The unwanted, where the unthreatened want us to go because they feel threatened by us. For just being..I will tell more about that later. This place is a literal dump of a city, buildings broken, streets cracked, cars broken. Everything here is just muted colors. The air is dry and so dirty we breath in visable red and grey dust. It is so sad and crowded here that many literally die on the streets. And it is normal here ever few hours a new soul comes inanother is given mercy and dies here. The energy here isn't so lively but dead. All there is is alot of bottles being thriwn and bar fights. Day in and day out we have so many issues. From gas,to food, to using the bathroom. It sucks here. One is lucky to have at least a home here.. Alot of rubble gets on your clothes and your hair and you know where. ITS GETS EVERYWHERE..I don't know how long I've been here but..The agriculture here gets worse and worse. Barely any plants, flowers, trees nothing. But it is a sense of home to me. As ugly and as nasty as it can smell or be. We all got some sort of loving yet hated relationship. The art here is so fascinating and the music and the culture. We all try to survive in this wave within the afterlife.Well our afterlife, everyone else who isn't here is thriving. I like to think my home is a lost and found dump. Many of us are lost, with no home no shelter no heart but a lot of valuable emotions can be found here. If many were willing to open up and try to make change. It feels lonely here regardless of the over population here. It feels like am emotional desert with high waves of heat and low waves of of something. Filled with greed, lust, sins and no abundance. It feels like a lustful limbo..lusting for more happiness and for greatness but this place isn't me nor where I want to be. Traveler where ever you are cherish what you have. WE HAVE PIGEON-RATS HERE, AS DISGUSTING AS IT SOUNDS IT'S TERRIBLE. THEY EAT YOUR FOOD, SQUIRM AROUND THE SQUARE AND PURPOSELY TOOT ON YOUR FOOD. It's revolting and very unappetizing. many here starve due too those little rascals. The king doesn't want to do a thing about our conditions and issues. I live in a dump heep of a place and it feels like hell here. Why can't it get better..the food here is getting worse. 
I NEED TO BE SAVED. NOW EXCUSE ME I WILL CRY MY EYES OUT.</p>
